Node-Packer

Author: Stephen Walters <stephenwalters@gmail.com>

This is a binary data packer/unpacker for node.js. Supposedly, it is
functionally identical to python's struct.pack and struct.unpack, however,
it is nowhere near identical in practice.

Right now, the byte ordering support is not at all there. That is, the format
strings' first characters encoding directives (@, or =, or >, or <, or !) are
ignored completely. Also, only a few encoding types are supported, currently
just 'b', 'c', 'x', 'I', 'L', and 'B'.

I wrote this as a support structure for another project and just repackaged it
here, hence it's incompleteness. Being a strong YAGNI supporter, I didn't think
it was necessary to implement the features I wasn't going to use.
